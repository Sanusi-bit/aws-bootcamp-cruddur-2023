### Install AWS CLI

I was able to Install AWS CLI using gitpod and the code for installing the AWS CLI can be found in the [gitpod.yml](https://github.com/Sanusi-bit/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml) file

I then verified the installation of the AWS CLI by configuring it on gitpod and getting the caller identity for the user account created.

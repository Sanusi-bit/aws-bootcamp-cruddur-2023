# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

### 1. Install AWS CLI

I was able to Install AWS CLI using gitpod and the code for installing the AWS CLI can be found in the [gitpod.yml](https://github.com/Sanusi-bit/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml) file

I then verified the installation of the AWS CLI by configuring it on gitpod and getting the caller identity for the user account created.

### 2. Create a Budget

### 4. Recreate Logical architecture design for Cruddur

I recreated and completed the logical architecture diagram for Cruddur using Lucid Chart. I came across the challenge of importing the Momento logo at first but I later resolved it by getting a png file for the logo and uploading to a google driver. I then imported the logo to my lucid chart. Here is the [link](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/c36713c4-239d-4a80-910e-942f552be9d7/edit?viewport_loc=-81%2C-799%2C3053%2C1774%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_3e5b0eef-445b-46c1-a516-76172e0aaa43) to my Lucid Chart Page

I proceeded to getting a napkin to produce the raw conceptual design on.
